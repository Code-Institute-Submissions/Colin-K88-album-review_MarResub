## Colours
The only real additional color used was teal to make buttons and headings stand out and more appealing.


## Database
I used MongoDB as the database for this project. This projects database uses four collections;
-	Users
-	Categories
-	Albums

### Users

Storing users usernames and passwords allows users to register and log in/log out securely. 

### Categories

In the category section I held the genre types for the albums

### Albums

When a user added a new album the data was stored in this collection the album name, artist etc.

# Features

## Current Features

### Home Page
The home page is a simple layout using images and some brief paragraphs to give the user and overall idea of what the site is about
and what they can expect when they register an account.

### Add/Edit Album
This page will provide a form for user to fill and add/edit their review. They will give some basic info on the album like release date etc. Then they will write their review and express their thoughts with other users. If they change their mind ....no problem
and edit button is provided and user can simply adjust their form and save their new album review.

### Log in/Log out/Register
Simple forms that create the user info and stored in the database. Once they register they have access to the site functions 
and can log in and log out as needed.
